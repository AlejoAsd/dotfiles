Bash dotfiles. Contains a handy file structure and a few basic, useful aliases.

### Installation
Run `install.sh` to install.

```bash
~/.dotfiles/bash/install.sh
```

Any files that would be replaced will instead be backed up automatically by the installation script.

### Uninstallation
Running `uninstall.sh` deletes the installed dotfiles and restores the backed up files.

```bash
~/.dotfiles/bash/uninstall.sh
```
