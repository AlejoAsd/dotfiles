Git dotfile. Contains my global configuration, as well as some aliases.

### Installation
Run `install.sh` to install.

```bash
~/.dotfiles/git/install.sh
```

Any files that would be replaced will instead be backed up automatically by the installation script.

### Uninstallation
Running `uninstall.sh` deletes the installed dotfiles and restores the backed up files.

```bash
~/.dotfiles/git/uninstall.sh
```
