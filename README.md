# Dotfiles
Dotfiles are files that contain configurations. They are called dotfiles because they usually have a '.' (dot) prefix to mark them as hidden files in Unix-like shells. This repository is not meant for dotfiles only, but configuration files in general. There is a folder for each system/shell/tool/environment containing their related configuration files. 

# Installation
When appropriate, a README will be included with specific installation instructions.
