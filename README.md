# Dotfiles
Dotfiles are files that contain configurations. They are called dotfiles because they usually have a '.' (dot) prefix to mark them as hidden files in Unix-like shells. This repository is not meant for dotfiles only, but configuration files in general. There is a folder for each system/shell/tool/environment containing their related configuration files. 

# Installation
To get started, clone the repository to `~/.dotfiles`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alejoasd/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
```

When appropriate, a README within each directory will be included with specific installation instructions.
